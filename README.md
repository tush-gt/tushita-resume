Hello! I am Tushita Prahsant Patil, I will be in my pre-final year soon, as I am done with my second year examinations.
I am an avid learner, and I am strong in my academics, along with that I am passionate about Cloud computing and Data Science - with wanting a career in those fields.
I am currently learning Full Stack development, as the field interests and challenges me, I am profficient in Java and Javascript while being relatively new to React, 
Node and Express. I am exploring and constantly learning these fields, to make sure I instill an ability to solve real world problems by leveraging my skills in them.
